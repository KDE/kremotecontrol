KDELIRC is a KDE frontend for the Linux Infrared Remote Control system. It has two
aims:

1. Provide a control center module for configuration of:
	a) Application bindings to remote control buttons.
	b) Actual remote controls installed (i.e. lirc configuration).
2. Provide a system-tray applet to act as a proxy between the LIRC system and KDE
	(applications), in order to launch DCOP requests (and potentially other IPC
	signals) to applications (and potentially collect/display results).

The design of the system is really quite simple---a control center module modifies a
centralised configuration file to determine what action(s) should be taken on a remote
control's button press.

The same(?) module also provides a front-end for the input of /etc/lircd.conf, necessary to
specify remote controls to the LIRC system. An extra (standard-format XML-based) may be
provided with the remote control description to give less-sucky Unix-like (lower case, no
spaces/symbols) names, and perhaps other metadata like a clickable image map of the remote
control itself.

The system tray applet interfaces with LIRC in order to catch key presses on remote
controls. It is then able to communicate with and potentially start applications through
DCOP.
