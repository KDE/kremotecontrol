general:
* Take out kdedmodule_stub.h, install by default (KDE4)
* Do a small installation README

kcmlirc:
* Check if irkick available; if not ask if they want to start it
* Get rid of pid in non-KUniqueApplication DCOP stuff to make interface nicer (should be fairly easy).

irkick:
* Change irkick to dcop service, not kded module
