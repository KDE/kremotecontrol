Todos / Bugs
-------------------
* check why when use dbus selector to add some action to app we see only kdeapps and not all DBUS app
* check why not ask if you want start it on kde startup when you close irkick
* check why not autostart if set it in systemsetting as autostart with KDE ( if we fix the first point this is not needed... )

* check why resetModes is called twiced after starting lirc
    -> It is not called twice... It is called once for every installed remote...
    -> IMHO we can skip this point as the code would be too complex just for skipping one notification
* editmode: krazy2
* editmode:  edit action: hide cancel / ok from kdialog or rewrite dialog
    -> Hidden for now... But it's not the "KDE way"(TM)
* kcmlirc -> add -> add actions: dbus options should be placed on top
    -> Why? IMHO the default user likes profiles more then fiddling around with DBus 
* when deleting a mode, action which switches to the mode should also be deleted
* When deleting the default mode (not the master-mode) the master mode should be set to the default mode
* test, test, test and put issue here ;-)
